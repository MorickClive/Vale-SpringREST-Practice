# Vale-SpringREST-Practice

A Spring REST API that uses the NoteTracker project as a goal outline. The focus of this project is to cover Spring Framework implementation of a RESTful api.

The project will focus on generating the 'Person' model and then adapt to a one-to-many relationship based on the note-notegroup relationship.
The relationships of database tables will be reflected in Entity Annotations.
